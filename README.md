# Snow-Man

The "Snowman Project" involves creating an interactive web page that showcases a snowman, complete with the ability to customize its appearance using HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript. This project allows you to demonstrate your skills in designing, styling, and enhancing user interactions on a web page.

Project Requirements
HTML Structure: Build the basic structure of the snowman using HTML elements. These elements might include circles for the snowman's body parts (head, body, and base), buttons for eyes, and additional elements for facial features (nose, mouth), arms, and accessories.

CSS Styling: Apply CSS to style the snowman's elements. You can use CSS to set the colors, dimensions, positions, and visual properties (like gradients) of the different parts of the snowman. Make use of classes and IDs to target specific elements for styling.

Interactive Features: If you're looking for an extra challenge, incorporate JavaScript to add interactivity to the snowman. This could include features like changing the snowman's colors, adding and removing accessories, and even animating the snowman's movements (such as waving).

Responsive Design: Ensure that the snowman's appearance and interactivity work well on different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
